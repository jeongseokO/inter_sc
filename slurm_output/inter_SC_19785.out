Let\'s call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". Then, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is x - (x/2) = x/2. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:\n\nx/2 = 5\n\nStep 3: To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:\n\nx = 10\n\nStep 4: So, Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners. ******\n\nStep 5: The answer is #### 10. ******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let\'s start by identifying the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left, which is 5. ******\n\nStep 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners.

Let\'s call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\nStep 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.\n\nStep 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nStep 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.\n\nStep 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.\n\nStep 11: Since Melanie can\'t have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number: x = 11.\n\n#### 11******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet\'s break this problem down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let\'s call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\nStep 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.\n\nStep 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nStep 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.\n\nStep 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.\n\nStep 11: Since Melanie can\'t have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number: x = 11.\n\n#### 11******', "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's start by identifying the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left, which is 5. ******\n\nStep 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.

This means the number of white carnations is 200 / 5 = 40.\n\nStep 2: Sandra also ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is 4 x 40 = 160.\n\nStep 3: The problem asks how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. Since the order is incomplete, we need to find the number of red roses that are missing. To do this, we subtract the number of red roses Fred has already delivered from the total number of red roses ordered.\n\nStep 4: Since we don't know the number of red roses Fred has already delivered, we'll represent it as a variable, x. The number of red roses that are missing is the difference between the total number of red roses ordered and the number already delivered: 160 - x.\n\nStep 5: Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. This means Fred must deliver all the missing red roses by 5 pm. Therefore, the number of red roses Fred must deliver is the number of red roses that are missing, which is 160 - x = 0 (since all must be delivered by 5 pm).\n\nStep 6: To find the value of x, we can set up an equation: 160 - x = 0.

We can set up an equation based on this information:\n\nMark's age 2 years ago = (Jan's age 2 years ago) / 2 + 5\n\nStep 3: Since Jan is currently 30 years old, her age 2 years ago was 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nStep 4: Substitute Jan's age 2 years ago into the equation:\n\nMark's age 2 years ago = 28 / 2 + 5\n= 14 + 5\n= 19\n\nStep 5: Since Mark was 19 years old 2 years ago, his current age is 19 + 2 = 21.\n\nStep 6: Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is 21 + 2 = 23.\n\nStep 7: The answer is #### 23.******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's denote Mark's current age as M. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is M + 2. ******\n\nStep 2: Two years ago, Mark's age was M - 2. The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. So, we can write an equation:\n\nM - 2 = 5 + (1/2)(Jan's age - 2)\n\nSince Jan's current age is 30, two years ago Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28. Substituting this into the equation, we get:\n\nM - 2 = 5 + (1/2)(28 - 2)\nM - 2 = 5 + 13\nM - 2 = 18\nM = 20\n\nStep 3: Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is M + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22. ******\n\nStep 4: The answer is #### 22. ******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's denote Mark's current age as M.

Since Jan is 30, two years ago Jan's age was 28.\n\nStep 3: Two years ago, Mark's age was x - 2. Since Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, we can set up the equation:\n\nx - 2 = 5 + 14\n\nwhere 14 is half of Jan's age (28) two years ago.\n\nStep 4: Solve for x:\n\nx - 2 = 19\nx = 21\n\nStep 5: Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:\n\nx + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23\n\nStep 6: The answer is #### 23.******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Jean is two years older than Mark, so if Mark's current age is x, Jean's current age is x + 2.\n\nStep 2: Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
