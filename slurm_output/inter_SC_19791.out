Let\'s call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". Then, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is x - (x/2) = x/2. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:\n\nx/2 = 5\n\nStep 3: To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:\n\nx = 10\n\nStep 4: So, Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners. ******\n\nStep 5: The answer is #### 10. ******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let\'s start by identifying the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left, which is 5. ******\n\nStep 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners.

Let\'s call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\nStep 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.\n\nStep 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nStep 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.\n\nStep 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.\n\nStep 11: Since Melanie can\'t have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number: x = 11.\n\n#### 11******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet\'s break this problem down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let\'s call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\nStep 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.\n\nStep 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nStep 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.\n\nStep 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.\n\nStep 11: Since Melanie can\'t have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number: x = 11.\n\n#### 11******', "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's start by identifying the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left, which is 5. ******\n\nStep 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Since it's two-thirds water, the amount of water is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.\n\nStep 2: Let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, the amount of water is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.\n\nStep 3: The total amount of water initially is 6.67 liters (from orange drink) + 9 liters (from pineapple drink) = 15.67 liters.\n\nStep 4: As I spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the total amount of water decreases by 0.67 liters (since 1 liter is 2/3 water).\n\nStep 5: The new total amount of water is 15.67 - 0.67 = 15 liters.\n\nStep 6: The total amount of drink after adding the two is 10 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 25 liters.
