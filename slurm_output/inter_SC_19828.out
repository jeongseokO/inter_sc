Step 1: Let's calculate the cost of the first 8 glasses (since the 9th glass onwards will be at a discounted price). 8 glasses at $5 each will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Step 2: For the remaining 8 glasses, the cost will be 8 * (5 * 0.6) = 8 * $3 = $24.

Step 3: Add the cost of the first 8 glasses and the remaining 8 glasses: $40 + $24 = $64.

Step 4: The answer is #### 64.******
