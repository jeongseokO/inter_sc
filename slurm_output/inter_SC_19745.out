Step 5: Josh sells the house for its new value, which is $120,000. ******

Step 4: Josh sold the house for $200,000. He spent $130,000, so his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. ******

Step 5: The profit is the difference between the new value and the total amount spent. ******

Step 6: Profit = $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000. ******

Step 1: Let's first calculate the cost of the first 8 glasses. 8 glasses will cost 8 * $5 = $40.

Step 2: The next 8 glasses will cost 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3 per glass. So, the cost of the next 8 glasses will be 8 * $3 = $24.

Step 3: In total, Kylar will pay $40 + $24 = $64.

Step 4: The answer is #### 64. ******

Step 1: Let's calculate the cost of the first glass. Since it costs $5. ******

Step 2: The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 x $5 = $3. ******

Step 3: The cost of the third glass is again $5, and so on. ******

Step 4: The pattern is: $5, $3, $5, $3, ... (alternating between $5 and $3). ******

Step 5: Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. Since it's an alternating pattern, we can divide 16 by 2 to get the number of glasses at the full price ($5 each): 16 ÷ 2 = 8. ******

Step 6: The remaining 8 glasses will be at the discounted price of $3 each. ******

Step 7: Calculate the total cost: 8 glasses at $5 each = 8 x $5 = $40, and 8 glasses at $3 each = 8 x $3 = $24. ******

Step 8: Add the costs: $40 + $24 = $64. ******

Step 3: The third glass costs $5 again, and so on. We can see a pattern that every other glass costs $5, and the ones in between cost $3. ******

Step 4: To find the total cost, we can count the number of glasses that cost $5 and the number of glasses that cost $3. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find the number of glasses that cost $5, which is 8. The remaining 8 glasses will cost $3 each. ******

Step 5: The total cost of the 8 glasses that cost $5 is 8 * $5 = $40. The total cost of the 8 glasses that cost $3 is 8 * $3 = $24. ******

Step 6: To find the total cost, we add the cost of the two types of glasses: $40 + $24 = $64. ******

Step 6: We can calculate the total cost by adding the costs of each type of glass:

Step 1: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

Step 2: He turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance.

Step 3: He then spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

Step 4: He spends the remaining time of 4 - 2.5 = 1.5 hours driving at a speed of 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

Step 5: In total, John covers a distance of 180 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles.

Step 1: John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

Step 2: Then, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so his position doesn't change.

Step 3: Next, he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

Step 4: Finally, he drives for the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph, covering a distance of 2 * 80 = 160 miles.

Step 5: In total, John drives a distance of 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Step 6: Since he turned around after 3 hours, he is 355 miles away from home at the end of the 4 hours.

Step 1: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3 * 60 = 180 miles.

Step 2: He then turns around and spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he doesn't move at all.

Step 3: He then drives for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph, so he covers a distance of 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

Step 4: He then spends the remaining 2 hours driving at a speed of 80 mph, so he covers a distance of 2 * 80 = 160 miles.

Step 5: The total distance he has covered is 180 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles.

Step 6: Since he is now going back home, he is 355 miles away from home.
