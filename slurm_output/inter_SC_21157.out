To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can subtract her average speed for the first 6 miles from her desired average speed:\n\nrequired speed = desired average speed - average speed for the first 6 miles\nrequired speed = 4 miles per hour - 3 miles per hour\nrequired speed = 1 mile per hour\n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of #### 1.******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nMarissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, which means her speed for the first 4 miles is 4 miles per hour ******.
