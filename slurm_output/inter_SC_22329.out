The buyer received notice of the barn's destruction on January 21 and cancelled the deal. The buyer is now suing the seller for a refund.\n\nStep 2: Determine the legal title: As the contract was still in effect until the settlement date of March 1, the seller held the legal title to the farm.\n\nStep 3: Determine the equitable title: The buyer had already paid the down payment, which means they had an equitable interest in the property. However, since the contract was still in effect, the seller's legal title prevails.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion: Since the buyer did not yet have legal title to the farm, they cannot claim to have held the legal title to the farm.

The man borrowed $150,000 from the bank and $40,000 from his mother, securing both loans with a mortgage on the home. The bank modified the loan to reduce the monthly payments, but did not inform the mother. The mother commenced foreclosure and claimed that her mortgage became a first lien and the bank's mortgage became a second lien.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relevant laws and principles. In most jurisdictions, a mortgage is a lien that is superior to subsequent liens, unless the subsequent lienholder has actual or constructive notice of the prior lien.\n\nStep 3: Apply the laws and principles to the facts. The bank's loan modification did not alter the principal amount or interest rate, and the man was not in default on his payments to the mother at the time of the modification. Therefore, the modification did not affect the mother's rights or interest in the property.\n\nStep 4: Determine the mother's assertion. The mother claims that her mortgage became a first lien and the bank's mortgage became a second lien. However, the bank's loan modification did not change the mother's rights or interest in the property. The mother's mortgage remains a junior lien to the bank's mortgage, which was recorded first.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the answer. The mother's assertion is incorrect. The bank's loan modification did not make her mortgage a first lien, and the bank's mortgage remains a superior lien to the mother's mortgage.

The phase shift Δφ is given by:\n\nΔφ = (2π / λ) (n2 - n1) d\n\nwhere λ is the wavelength, n1 and n2 are the refractive indices, and d is the thickness of the layer.\n\nStep 3: For the given layer of oil, the phase shift due to the transition from air to oil is:\n\nΔφ = (2π / 500 nm) (1.5 - 1) 500 nm = π\n\nStep 4: The phase shift due to the transition from oil to water is:\n\nΔφ = (2π / 500 nm) (1.33 - 1.5) 500 nm = -2π\n\nStep 5: The total phase shift is the sum of the two phase shifts:\n\nΔφ = π - 2π = -π\n\nStep 6: Since the phase shift is negative, the reflected wave is out of phase with the incident wave, resulting in destructive interference.\n\nStep 7: To find the wavelength that experiences the largest change in phase, we need to minimize the denominator in the phase shift equation. This occurs when the wavelength is equal to the thickness of the layer:\n\nλ = 500 nm\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 500 nm, which corresponds to option #### A.******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: We need to find the most strongly reflected wavelength, which corresponds to the wavelength that experiences the largest change in phase due to the transition from the air (n=1) to the oil (n=1.5) and then to the water (n=1.33).\n\nStep 2: We can use the concept of phase shift due to refraction.

This occurs when the thickness of the oil layer is an integer multiple of λ/2.\n\nStep 11: For the given wavelengths, the thickness of the oil layer that would result in constructive interference****** is:\n\n* For 500 nm: λ/2 = 250 nm (greater than the actual thickness of 500 nm)\n* For 550 nm: λ/2 = 275 nm (greater than the actual thickness of 500 nm)\n* For 600 nm: λ/2 = 300 nm (greater than the actual thickness of 500 nm)\n* For 650 nm: λ/2 = 325 nm (greater than the actual thickness of 500 nm)\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is the one that results in constructive interference, which is 500 nm. The answer is #### A.******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Since the oil layer is thin, we can consider it as a thin film. The reflected light is due to the interference between the light reflected from the top surface of the oil and the light reflected from the bottom surface of the oil.\n\nStep 2: The phase difference between the two reflected waves is given by the difference in the optical path lengths:\n\nΔ = 2 × (thickness of oil layer) × (index of refraction of oil - index of refraction of water)\n\nStep 3: Since the wavelength of light is 500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, or 650 nm, we need to find the thickness of the oil layer that would result in constructive interference for each wavelength.\n\nStep 4: For constructive interference, the phase difference Δ should be a multiple of 2π:\n\nΔ = 2 × (thickness of oil layer) × (1.5 - 1.33) = 2πn\n\nwhere n is an integer.\n\nStep 5: Solving for the thickness of the oil layer, we get:\n\nthickness of oil layer = πn / (1.5 - 1.33)\n\nStep 6: For each wavelength, we calculate the corresponding thickness of the oil layer:\n\n* For 500 nm: thickness of oil layer = π(1) / (1.5 - 1.33) ≈ 140 nm\n* For 550 nm: thickness of oil layer = π(2) / (1.5 - 1.33) ≈ 280 nm\n* For 600 nm: thickness of oil layer = π(3) / (1.5 - 1.33) ≈ 420 nm\n* For 650 nm: thickness of oil layer = π(4) / (1.5 - 1.33) ≈ 560 nm\n\nStep 7: Since the oil layer is 500 nm thick, it is thinner than the calculated thickness for all the wavelengths. Therefore, the reflected light will be due to the interference between the light reflected from the top surface of the oil and the light reflected from the bottom surface of the oil.\n\nStep 8: The most strongly reflected wavelength is the one that results in destructive interference, which occurs when the phase difference is π.
