completions: ["<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with x. Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\nStep 2: After selling at the green house, she had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 3: Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left, she sold (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nStep 5: After selling at the orange house, she had 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 3 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 6: The problem states that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nx/3 - 3 = 5\n\nStep 7: To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx/3 = 8\n\nStep 8: Finally, we can multiply both sides by 3 to get:\n\nx = 24\n\nSo, Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 3: Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.\n\nStep 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means that the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is equal to the initial number of vacuum cleaners minus the number she has left.\n\nStep 6: So, we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5\n\nStep 8: Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10\n\nStep 9: Simplify the equation: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - x + x/3 + 2 = 10\n\nStep 10: Combine like terms: 2x/3 - 4 + 2 = 10\n\nStep 11: Add 4 and subtract 2 from both sides: 2x/3 = 14\n\nStep 12: Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction: 2x = 42\n\nStep 13: Divide both sides by 2: x = 21\n\nStep 14: The answer is #### 21.******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. ****** Step 2: She sold a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. ****** Step 3: She sold 2 more at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. ****** Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. ****** Step 5: This means she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5. ****** Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 ****** Step 7: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10 ****** Step 8: Simplify the equation: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - x + x/3 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 9: Combine like terms: 2x/3 - 4 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 10: Add 4 and subtract 2 from both sides: 2x/3 = 14 ****** Step 11: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 42 ****** Step 12: Divide both sides by 2: x = 21 ****** Step 13: The answer is #### 21. ******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. ****** Step 2: She sold a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. ****** Step 3: She sold 2 more at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. ****** Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. ****** Step 5: This means she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5. ****** Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 ****** Step 7: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10 ****** Step 8: Simplify the equation: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - x + x/3 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 9: Combine like terms: 2x/3 - 4 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 10: Add 4 and subtract 2 from both sides: 2x/3 = 14 ****** Step 11: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 42 ****** Step 12: Divide both sides by 2: x = 21 ****** Step 13: The answer is #### 21. ******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. ****** Step 2: She sold a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. ****** Step 3: She sold 2 more at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. ****** Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. ****** Step 5: This means she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5. ****** Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 ****** Step 7: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10 ****** Step 8: Simplify the equation: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - x + x/3 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 9: Combine like terms: 2x/3 - 4 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 10: Add 4 and subtract 2 from both sides: 2x/3 = 14 ****** Step 11: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 42 ****** Step 12: Divide both sides by 2: x = 21 ****** Step 13: The answer is #### 21. ******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners. ****** Step 2: She sold a third of them at the green house, which is x/3. ****** Step 3: She sold 2 more at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left. ****** Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. ****** Step 5: This means she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5. ****** Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5 ****** Step 7: Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - (x - x/3 - 2) = 10 ****** Step 8: Simplify the equation: 2x - 2x/3 - 4 - x + x/3 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 9: Combine like terms: 2x/3 - 4 + 2 = 10 ****** Step 10: Add 4 and subtract 2 from both sides: 2x/3 = 14 ****** Step 11: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 42 ****** Step 12: Divide both sides by 2: x = 21 ****** Step 13: The answer is #### 21. ******"]

Then, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50y.\n\nStep 3: We know that Brittany's phone can hold x photographs, and x is equal to 50y. So, we can write an equation:\n\nx = 50y\n\nStep 4: We also know that Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can write another equation:\n\n6x = 1800\n\nStep 5: Substitute the expression for x from Step 3 into the equation from Step 4:\n\n6(50y) = 1800\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation:\n\n300y = 1800\n\nStep 7: Divide both sides by 300:\n\ny = 6\n\nStep 8: So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.\n\nThe answer is #### 6.******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. This means Brittany's phone can hold 1/6 of what Jamal's phone can hold. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, so Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.\n\nStep 2: The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's call the number of ducks x. Then, 50x is the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.\n\nStep 3: Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation: 50x = 300. To solve for x, we divide both sides by 50: x = 300 / 50 = 6.\n\nStep 4: So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.\n\n#### 6******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
