Step 1: The program had 60 downloads in the first month. ******

Step 2: The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so it was 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. ******

Step 3: In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30%, which means 30% of 180 was subtracted. To find 30% of 180, multiply 180 by 0.3, which is 54. So, the number of downloads in the third month was 180 - 54 = 126. ******

Step 4: The total number of downloads over the three months is the sum of the downloads in each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366. ******

The answer is #### 366. ******

Step 3: The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. ******


Step 4: To find out when Carlos starts earning money, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for each year.

Year 1: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3 + $90 (initial cost) = $93, Net loss = $93 - $10.50 = -$82.50

Year 2: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net profit = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Since the net profit in Year 2 is positive, Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree in the second year.

Step 3: The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. ******


Step 4: To find out when Carlos starts earning money, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for each year.

Year 1: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3 + $90 (initial cost) = $93, Net loss = $93 - $10.50 = -$82.50

Year 2: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net profit = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Since the net profit in Year 2 is positive, Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree in the second year.

Gen2: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: After selling at the orange house, she has 2x/3 - 2 - x/3 = x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 6: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x/3 = 5.

Step 7: To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 15.

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, this means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Step 8: Simplify the equation: 3x - 12 - 3x + 3 + 6 = 30

Step 9: Combine like terms: -12 + 6 = 30

Step 10: Solve for x: x = 18

Step 11: The answer is #### 18.******

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: After selling at the orange house, she has 2x/3 - 2 - x/3 = x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 6: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x/3 = 5.

Step 7: To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 15.

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left, which is 5. ******

Step 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". After selling a third at the green house, she had x - (1/3)x = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners. ******

Step 3: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x/3 - 1 = 5

Step 4: To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

x/3 = 6

Step 5: Multiply both sides by 3 to get:

x = 18

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

Step 1: Calculate the expected value of the jewelry after the market rise:

$5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125

Step 2: Calculate the expected value of the electronic gadgets after the market rise:

$8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096

Step 3: Calculate the profit for each option:

Option 1 (Jewelry): $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

Option 2 (Electronic Gadgets): $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Gen4: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Let's calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the jewelry option.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= (5,000 x (1 + 0.025)) - 5,000
= 5,000 x 0.025
= 125

Step 2: Let's calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets option.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= (8,000 x (1 + 0.012)) - 8,000
= 8,000 x 0.012
= 96

Step 3: Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to compare the profits from both options.

The profit from the jewelry option is 125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets option is 96. Since 125 is greater than 96, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

Gen5: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Let's calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the jewelry option.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= (5,000 x (1 + 0.025)) - 5,000
= 5,000 x 0.025
= 125

Step 2: Let's calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets option.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= (8,000 x (1 + 0.012)) - 8,000
= 8,000 x 0.012
= 96

Step 3: Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to compare the profits from both options.

The profit from the jewelry option is 125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets option is 96. Since 125 is greater than 96, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

Gen6: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the jewelry plan.
The merchant will spend $5,000 and the jewelry market will rise 2.5%, so the value of the jewelry will increase to $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,125.
The profit will be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.

Step 2: Calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets plan.

Step 1: Calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher:
She works 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly salary as a teacher is:
35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary as a teacher is:
$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Step 2: Calculate Jill's annual salary as a cheerleading coach:
She works 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly salary as a coach is:
15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual salary as a coach is:
$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Step 3: Add the annual salaries from both jobs to get the total annual salary:
$35,000/year (as a teacher) + $22,500/year (as a coach) = $57,500/year

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the remaining 3.33 liters are not water. ******

Step 1: The orange drink is 2/3 water, so 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters of water.

Step 3: In total, there is 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink, making a total of 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water.

Step 4: As 1 liter of orange drink is spilled, the total amount of water is reduced by 1 liter, leaving 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water.

Step 1: First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a liter, we'll round it to 6.67 liters. This means the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Now, we pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, but spill 1 liter. This means we add 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink to the pineapple drink.

Step 4: The total amount of water in the combined drinks is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks minus the spilled liter. The total water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters include the combined drinks, so we subtract the total water from the total volume to find the amount of non-water content: 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

Step 6: Finally, the remaining 24 liters contain 14.67 liters of water and 9.33 liters of non-water content.

The answer is: #### 14.67******

Step 1: First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a liter, we'll round it to 6.67 liters. This means the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Now, we pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, but spill 1 liter. This means we add 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink to the pineapple drink.

Step 4: The total amount of water in the combined drinks is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks minus the spilled liter. The total water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters include the combined drinks, so we subtract the total water from the total volume to find the amount of non-water content: 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

Step 6: Finally, the remaining 24 liters contain 14.67 liters of water and 9.33 liters of non-water content.

Step 3: In total, there is 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink, making a total of 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water.

Step 4: As 1 liter of orange drink is spilled, the total amount of water is reduced by 1 liter, leaving 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water.

Step 5: The total volume of the remaining drink is 24 liters, and the amount of water in it is 14.67 liters.

Step 6: The answer is #### 14.67.******
Gen2: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the remaining 3.33 liters are not water. ******

Step 2: Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the remaining 6 liters are not water. ******

Step 3: The orange drink is 6.67 liters, and 1 liter is spilled, so the remaining orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is 6.67 liters. ******

Step 4: The pineapple drink is 9 liters, and we are combining it with the remaining orange drink, which is 9 liters. The total amount of drink is 9 + 9 = 18 liters. ******

Step 5: The amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, and the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. ******

Step 6: The total amount of drink is 24 liters, and the amount of water is 15.67 liters. The remaining non-water portion is 24 - 15.67 = 8.33 liters. ******

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the remaining 3.33 liters are not water. ******

Step 2: Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the remaining 6 liters are not water. ******

Step 3: The orange drink is 6.67 liters, and 1 liter is spilled, so the remaining orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is 6.67 liters. ******

Step 4: The pineapple drink is 9 liters, and we are combining it with the remaining orange drink, which is 9 liters. The total amount of drink is 9 + 9 = 18 liters. ******

Step 5: The amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters, and the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. ******

Step 6: The total amount of drink is 24 liters, and the amount of water is 15.67 liters. The remaining non-water portion is 24 - 15.67 = 8.33 liters. ******

#### 15.67******
Gen4: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a liter, we'll round it to 6.67 liters. This means the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Now, we pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, but spill 1 liter. This means we add 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink to the pineapple drink.

Step 4: The total amount of water in the combined drinks is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks minus the spilled liter. The total water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters include the combined drinks, so we subtract the total water from the total volume to find the amount of non-water content: 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

Step 6: Finally, the remaining 24 liters contain 14.67 liters of water and 9.33 liters of non-water content.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let the original price of the book be x.

Step 2: The discount is 25%, which means the discount amount is 25% of the original price, or 0.25x.

Step 3: The sale price is the original price minus the discount, which is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

Step 4: The sale price is given as $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

Step 5: To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Step 5: To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Step 6: Simplify the fraction:

x = 26.00

Step 7: The original price of the book was $26.00.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let the original price of the book be x.

Step 2: The discount is 25%, which means the discount amount is 25% of the original price, or 0.25x.

Step 3: The sale price is the original price minus the discount, which is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

Step 4: The sale price is given as $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

Step 5: To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Step 6: Simplify the fraction:

x = 26.00

Step 7: The original price of the book was $26.00.

The answer is #### 26.00.******

Step 1: The total cost of the meal, milk, and apples is calculated.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Total cost of meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: The total amount Marie paid is $50. The difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the meal, milk, and apples is the cost of the pizza.

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of meal, milk, and apples) = $17

Step 3: The cost of each box of pizza is $8.50. To find the number of boxes of pizza, divide the cost of the pizza ($17) by the cost of each box ($8.50).

$17 (cost of pizza) ÷ $8.50 (cost of each box) = 2

Gen4: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: The total cost of the meal, milk, and apples is calculated.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Total cost of meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: The total amount Marie paid is $50. The difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the meal, milk, and apples is the cost of the pizza.

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of meal, milk, and apples) = $17

Step 3: The cost of each box of pizza is $8.50. To find the number of boxes of pizza, divide the cost of the pizza ($17) by the cost of each box ($8.50).

$17 (cost of pizza) ÷ $8.50 (cost of each box) = 2

Step 4: The answer is #### 2.******
Gen5: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: The total cost of the meal, milk, and apples is calculated.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Total cost of meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: The total amount Marie paid is $50. The difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the meal, milk, and apples is the cost of the pizza.

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of meal, milk, and apples) = $17

Step 3: The cost of each box of pizza is $8.50. To find the number of boxes of pizza, divide the cost of the pizza ($17) by the cost of each box ($8.50).

$17 (cost of pizza) ÷ $8.50 (cost of each box) = 2

Step 1: Marie ordered a chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each. ******

Step 2: The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
$12 + (5 x $3) + (4 x $1.50) = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 3: Marie paid a total of $50. The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $33. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17

Step 4: Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

Step 2: The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
$12 + (5 x $3) + (4 x $1.50) = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 3: Marie paid a total of $50. The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $33. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17

Step 4: Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

Step 5: The answer is #### 2. ******
Gen8: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: The total cost of the items Marie ordered before the pizza is: 1 chicken meal ($12) + 5 packs of milk ($3 each) = 5 x $3 = $15 + $12 = $27 + 4 apples ($1.50 each) = 4 x $1.50 = $6 + $27 = $33.

Step 2: The total amount Marie paid is $50, so the cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Step 3: Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes Marie ordered is $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

Step 4: The answer is #### 2.******

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Let's call the cost of the boots "x".

Step 2: The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, so we can set up the equation:

Heels 1 + Heels 2 = x - 5

Step 3: One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so we can write:

Heels 1 = $33
Heels 2 = 2 * $33 = $66

Step 4: Substitute the values of Heels 1 and Heels 2 into the equation:

$33 + $66 = x - 5

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

$99 = x - 5

Step 6: Add 5 to both sides to get:

$104 = x

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Let's call the cost of the boots "x".

Step 2: The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, so we can set up the equation:

Heels 1 + Heels 2 = x - 5

Step 3: One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so we can write:

Heels 1 = $33
Heels 2 = 2 * $33 = $66

Step 4: Substitute the values of Heels 1 and Heels 2 into the equation:

$33 + $66 = x - 5

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

$99 = x - 5

Step 6: Add 5 to both sides to get:

$104 = x

Step 7: The answer is #### 104.******
Gen2: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Let's find the cost of the second pair of heels. Since one pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, the second pair costs 2 * $33 = $66. ******

Step 2: The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since they cost five dollars less than the boots, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104. ******

Step 1: Let's start by finding the cost of the second pair of heels. Since it costs twice as much as the first pair, and the first pair costs $33, the second pair costs 2 x $33 = $66. ******

Step 2: The two pairs of heels together cost $5 less than the boots, so the total cost of the heels is the cost of the boots minus $5. Let's call the cost of the boots "x". Then, the cost of the heels is x - 5. ******

Step 3: The cost of the heels is the sum of the costs of the two pairs: $33 + $66 = x - 5. ******

Step 1: Let's say the number of silver coins Gretchen has is x. ******

Step 2: Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30. ******

Step 3: The total number of coins Gretchen has is 110, which is the sum of the number of silver coins and the number of gold coins. ******

x + (x + 30) = 110

Step 4: Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Step 5: Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Step 6: Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

Step 7: Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins:

Number of gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Step 8: The answer is #### 70. ******

Step 2: He runs 3 hours the first day, and half as much the other two days, which means he runs 1.5 hours each on the second and third days. ******

Step 3: To find his speed, we need to find the total time he runs in a day. He runs 3 hours the first day, and 1.5 hours each on the second and third days, so the total time is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours. ******


Step 4: Now we can find his speed by dividing the distance he runs (20 miles) by the time he runs (6 hours). 20 miles / 6 hours = 3.33 miles per hour. ******


Step 5: The answer is #### 3.33. ******

Step 1: First, we need to find the total number of calories in the bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.

Step 2: You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Step 3: Since each serving has 250 calories, you can eat a maximum of 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Step 4: Since there are 5 servings in the bag, you can eat 0.8 x 300g / 5 = 0.8 x 60g = 48g of the bag.

Gen2: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: First, we need to find the total number of calories in the bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total number of calories is 5 x 250 = 1250 calories.

Step 2: You have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left for the day.

Step 3: Since each serving has 250 calories, you can eat a maximum of 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Step 4: Since there are 5 servings in the bag, you can eat 0.8 x 300g / 5 = 0.8 x 60g = 48g of the bag.

Step 5: The answer is #### 48.******

Step 1: Let's start by finding the number of blue ties John bought. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so the number of blue ties is 200 / 40 = 5. ******

Step 2: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10. ******

Gen2: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Step 1: Let's start by finding the number of blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can set up the equation:

200 = x * 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 40:

x = 200 / 40
x = 5

So John bought 5 blue ties.

Step 2: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Step 3: The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. Since blue ties cost $40 each, red ties cost:

$40 * 1.5 = $60

Step 4: John spent $200 on blue ties, and we need to find out how much he spent on red ties. Since he bought 10 red ties, he spent:

10 * $60 = $600

Step 5: Add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent:

$200 + $600 = $800

The answer is #### 800.******

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so the number of blue ties he bought is:

200 / 40 = 5

Step 2: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

5 x 2 = 10

Step 3: The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

$40 (blue tie cost) x 1.5 (50% more) = $60

Step 4: The total cost of the red ties is:

10 (number of red ties) x $60 (cost per red tie) = $600

Step 5: The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties:

Step 1: Let's start by finding the number of blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can set up the equation:

200 = x * 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 40:

x = 200 / 40
x = 5

So John bought 5 blue ties.

Step 2: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Step 3: The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. Since blue ties cost $40 each, red ties cost:

$40 * 1.5 = $60

Step 4: John spent $200 on blue ties, and we need to find out how much he spent on red ties. Since he bought 10 red ties, he spent:

10 * $60 = $600

Step 3: The problem states that John spent $200 on blue ties, so we can set up the equation 40x = 200. Solving for x, we get x = 5. ******

Step 4: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2x = 2(5) = 10. ******


Step 5: The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since blue ties cost $40 each, red ties cost 40 + (50% of 40) = 40 + 20 = $60 each. ******


Step 6: The total cost of red ties is the number of red ties multiplied by the cost of each red tie, which is 10 * 60 = $600. ******


Step 7: The total cost of blue ties is $200, and the total cost of red ties is $600. To find the total cost of all ties, add the cost of blue ties and red ties: $200 + $600 = $800. ******

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so the number of blue ties he bought is:

200 / 40 = 5

Step 2: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

5 x 2 = 10

Step 3: The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

$40 (blue tie cost) x 1.5 (50% more) = $60

Step 4: The total cost of the red ties is:

10 (number of red ties) x $60 (cost per red tie) = $600

Step 5: The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties:

$200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so the number of blue ties he bought is:

200 / 40 = 5

Step 2: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

5 x 2 = 10

Step 3: The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:

$40 (blue tie cost) x 1.5 (50% more) = $60

Step 4: The total cost of the red ties is:

10 (number of red ties) x $60 (cost per red tie) = $600

Step 5: The total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and red ties:

$200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800

Step 1: Let's start by finding the number of blue ties John bought. Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can set up the equation:

200 = x * 40

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 40:

x = 200 / 40
x = 5

So John bought 5 blue ties.

Step 2: Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Step 3: The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, which means they cost 1.5 times the price of blue ties. Since blue ties cost $40 each, red ties cost:

$40 * 1.5 = $60

Step 4: John spent $200 on blue ties, and we need to find out how much he spent on red ties. Since he bought 10 red ties, he spent:

10 * $60 = $600

Step 5: Add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent:

$200 + $600 = $800

Step 2: Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs produced in a week is 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs. ******

Step 3: Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen. ******

Step 4: To find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces in a week, divide the total number of eggs by 12: 1764 ÷ 12 = 147 dozens. *******

Step 5: Since Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen, the total amount he makes in a week is 147 dozens * $2 = $294. *******
