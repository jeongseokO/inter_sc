To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.\n\nStep 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.\n\nStep 11: Since Melanie can\'t have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number: x = 11.\n\n#### 11******', "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.\n\nStep 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.\n\nStep 6: We can set up the equation:\n\nx - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 = x - 5\n\nStep 8: Add x/3 to both sides:\n\nx - 2 = x - 5 + x/3\n\nStep 9: Subtract x from both sides:\n\n-2 = -5 + x/3\n\nStep 10: Multiply both sides by 3:\n\n-6 = -15 + x\n\nStep 11: Add 15 to both sides:\n\nx = 9\n\nStep 12: The answer is #### 9.******", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities.
