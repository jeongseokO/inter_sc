completions: ["<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners x. A third of x is x/3.\n\nStep 2: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she now has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 3: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of x - x/3 - 2 is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.\n\nStep 4: This means she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of the previous sales. We can set up the equation:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + 1 = 5\n\nx/6 = 4\n\nx = 24\n\nStep 6: The answer is #### 24.************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************", "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
