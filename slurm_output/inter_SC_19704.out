This means that the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.\n\nStep 5: We can set up an equation using the information from steps 2 and 4: x - x/3 - 2 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = x - 5.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = x - 5\n\nStep 7: Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 + 3x - 6 = 6x - 30\n\nStep 8: Combine like terms: 7x - 18 = 6x - 30\n\nStep 9: Add 18 to both sides: 7x = 6x + 12\n\nStep 10: Subtract 6x from both sides: x = 12\n\nStep 11: The answer is #### 12. ******', "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners she started with x. Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\nStep 2: After selling at the green house, she had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 3: Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 5: After selling at the orange house, she had 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1 - 2x/3 + 2 = x/3 - 1 + 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 6: This is equal to 5 vacuum cleaners, which is what she has left. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx/3 - 1 + 2 = 5\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation:\n\nx/3 = 3\n\nStep 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\nx = 9\n\nStep 9: The answer is #### 9. ******", '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet\'s break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Since she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.\n\nStep 4: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means that the number of vacuum cleaners she sold is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 0\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 0\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 + 1) = 0\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - x + x/3 + 1 = 0\n\n-2 + 1 = 0\n\nx - 2 = 0\n\nx = 2\n\nStep 6: Since x represents the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, the answer is:\n\n#### 2 ******', "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
