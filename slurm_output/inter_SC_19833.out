Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house is x - (x/3 + 2). This means the number of vacuum cleaners left is x - (x/3 + 2) = x - x/3 - 2 = 3x/3 - 2 = x - 2.\n\nStep 5: Half of the remaining vacuum cleaners were sold at the orange house. So, Melanie sold (x - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 6: The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at each house: x/3 + x/3 + 2 + (x - 2)/2.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the expression: (x/3) + (x/3) + 2 + (x - 2)/2 = (2x/3) + 2 + (x - 2)/2 = (2x/3) + (x - 2)/2 + 2.\n\nStep 8: Combine like terms: (2x/3) + (x - 2)/2 + 2 = (2x + 3x - 6)/6 + 2 = (5x - 6)/6 + 2.\n\nStep 9: Simplify the fraction: (5x - 6)/6 = 5x/6 - 1.\n\nStep 10: Add 2 to both sides: (5x/6 - 1) + 2 = 5x/6 + 1.\n\nStep 11: The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had initially minus the number of vacuum cleaners left: 5x/6 + 1 = x - 5.\n\nStep 12: Simplify the equation: 5x/6 + 1 = x - 5.\n\nStep 13: Subtract x from both sides:****** 5x/6 - x + 1 = -5.\n\nStep 14: Simplify the equation: -x/6 + 1 = -5.\n\nStep 15: Add 5 to both sides: -x/6 + 1 + 5 = 0.\n\nStep 16: Simplify the equation: -x/6 + 6 = 0.\n\nStep 17: Subtract 6 from both sides: -x/6 = -6.\n\nStep 18: Multiply both sides by -6: x = 36.\n\nStep 19: The answer is #### 36.******", '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: Let\'s start by identifying the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left, which is 5. ******\n\nStep 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners.

Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners.
