Step 2: The tree will grow 7 lemons each year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total revenue from selling lemons each year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.50. ******

Step 4: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the cost: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. ******


Step 5: The tree will start earning money when the net profit is greater than the initial cost of planting the tree. So, we need to find the number of years it takes for the net profit to equal or exceed $90.

Step 6: In the first year, the net profit is $7.50, which is less than the initial cost of $90. In the second year, the net profit is $7.50, still less than $90. In the third year, the net profit is $7.50, still less than $90.

Step 7: In the fourth year, the net profit is $7.50, which is still less than $90. But in the fifth year, the net profit is $7.50, which equals $90. Therefore, it will take Carlos 5 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Step 6: The initial cost of planting the tree is $90, and the net profit each year is $7.50. We can set up an equation to represent the situation: 90 + 7.50x = 0, where x is the number of years.


Step 7: To solve for x, we can subtract 90 from both sides of the equation: 7.50x = -90.


Step 8: Divide both sides by 7.50: x = -90 / 7.50 = -12.


Step 9: Since the number of years cannot be negative, we can conclude that the tree will start earning money in the 13th year. ******

Step 2: The tree will grow 7 lemons each year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total revenue from selling lemons each year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.50. ******

Step 3: The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. ******


Step 4: To find out when Carlos starts earning money, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for each year.

Year 1: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $7.50
Year 2: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $7.50
Year 3: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $7.50
...
Year 8: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $7.47 (just barely breaks even)
Year 9: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net Profit = $7.47

Step 5: It takes 9 years for the tree to break even and start earning a profit. The answer is #### 9. ******

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, this means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.

Step 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.

Step 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 11: The answer is #### 11, since Melanie can't start with a fraction of a vacuum cleaner.******

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = 5

Step 6: Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - (x + 6) = 15

Step 7: Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 15

Step 8: Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 21

Step 9: Divide both sides by 2:

x = 10.5

Step 10: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners.

Step 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". After selling a third at the green house, she had x - (1/3)x = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners. ******

Step 3: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.

Step 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = 5

Step 6: Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3x - (x + 6) = 15

Step 7: Combine like terms:

2x - 6 = 15

Step 8: Add 6 to both sides:

2x = 21

Step 9: Divide both sides by 2:

x = 10.5

Step 10: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners.

Step 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". After selling a third at the green house, she had x - (1/3)x = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners. ******

Step 3: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.

Step 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.

Step 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, this means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Step 8: Simplify the equation: 3x - 12 - 3x + 3 + 6 = 30

Step 9: Combine like terms: -12 + 6 = 30 - 3x + 3x

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.

Step 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.

Step 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.

Step 5: Multiply both sides by 3 to get:

x = 18

Step 6: The answer is #### 18. ******

Step 1: Let's start by identifying the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left, which is 5. ******

Step 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, that means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". After selling a third at the green house, she had x - (1/3)x = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners. ******

Step 3: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x/3 - 1 = 5

Step 4: To solve for x, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation:

x/3 = 6

Step 5: Multiply both sides by 3 to get:

x = 18

Step 6: The answer is #### 18. ******

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, this means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Step 8: Simplify the equation: 3x - 12 - 3x + 3 + 6 = 30

Step 9: Combine like terms: -12 + 6 = 30 - 3x + 3x

Step 10: Simplify the equation: -6 = 30

Step 11: Solve for x: x = 36

Step 12: The answer is #### 36.******
