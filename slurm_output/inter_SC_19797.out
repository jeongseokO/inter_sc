Therefore, it will take Carlos 5 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.\n\nThe answer is #### 5. ******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. ******\n\nStep 2: The tree will grow 7 lemons each year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total revenue from selling lemons each year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.50. ******\n\nStep 3: The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. ******\n\n\nStep 4: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the cost: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. ******\n\n\nStep 5: The tree will start earning money when the net profit is greater than the initial cost of planting the tree. So, we need to find the number of years it takes for the net profit to equal or exceed $90.\n\nStep 6: In the first year, the net profit is $7.50, which is less than the initial cost of $90. In the second year, the net profit is $7.50, still less than $90. In the third year, the net profit is $7.50, still less than $90.\n\nStep 7: In the fourth year, the net profit is $7.50, which is still less than $90. But in the fifth year, the net profit is $7.50, which equals $90. Therefore, it will take Carlos 5 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.\n\nThe answer is #### 5. ******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: The tree costs $90 to plant. ****** Step 2: Each year, Carlos earns 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.50. ****** Step 3: However, it costs $3 per year to water and feed the tree, so his net earnings per year are $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. ****** Step 4: To break even, Carlos needs to earn $90 (the cost of planting the tree).
