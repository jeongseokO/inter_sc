Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.\n\nStep 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, this means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.\n\nStep 5: We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5\n\nStep 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5\n\nStep 7: Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30\n\nStep 8: Simplify the equation: 3x - 12 - 3x + 3 + 6 = 30\n\nStep 9: Combine like terms: -12 + 6 = 30 - 3x + 3x\n\nStep 10: Simplify the equation: -6 = 30\n\nStep 11: Solve for x: x = 36\n\nStep 12: The answer is #### 36.******", '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet\'s break this problem down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let\'s call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\nStep 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.\n\nStep 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nStep 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nStep 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.\n\nStep 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.\n\nStep 11: The answer is #### 11, since Melanie can\'t start with a fraction of a vacuum cleaner.******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet\'s break this problem down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
