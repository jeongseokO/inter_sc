Let's assume he has enough money to plant the tree.\n\nStep 2: Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. So, he earns $7 * $1.5 = $10.50 each year.\n\nStep 3: It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree, so he has to subtract that from his earnings. He earns $10.50 and spends $3, so his net earnings are $10.50 - $3 = $7.50.\n\nStep 4: Since he has to break even, he needs to earn enough to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.
