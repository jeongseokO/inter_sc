Since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, the profit is the difference between the new value and the cost: $120,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $120,000 - $130,000 = $-10,000\n5. However, Josh didn't lose money; he made a profit. The correct calculation is: $120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000 (this is the increase in value)\n6. To find the profit, subtract the cost of repairs from the increase in value: $40,000 - $50,000 = -$10,000 (wait, this is a loss!)\n7. Oops, it looks like Josh actually lost money! Let's recalculate the profit: $80,000 (initial cost) + $50,000 (cost of repairs) = $130,000 (total cost) - $80,000 (initial cost) = $50,000 (loss)\n\nThe answer is #### -50,000."]

After the restart, Carla has to start from the beginning, so she has to download the entire 80 GB again. This will take:\n\n80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes\n\n4. Adding the time it took to download the initial 80 GB (40 minutes) and the time it took for the restart (20 minutes), we get:\n\n40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes\n\n5.

This means that Carla has downloaded 40% of the file, which is:\n\n40% of 200,000 MB = 0.4 x 200,000 MB = 80,000 MB\n\n4. Since she has downloaded 80,000 MB, she has 200,000 MB - 80,000 MB = 120,000 MB left to download.\n5. The time it takes to download the remaining 120,000 MB is:\n\n120,000 MB / 2 MB/minute = 60,000 minutes\n\n6. Since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, she needs to add the time it took to download the first 80,000 MB to the time it takes to download the remaining 120,000 MB:\n\n80,000 MB / 2 MB/minute = 40,000 minutes (to download the first 80,000 MB) + 60,000 minutes (to download the remaining 120,000 MB) = 100,000 minutes\n\n7.

To find the amount downloaded before the restart, multiply the total download size by the percentage:\n\n200 GB x 0.40 = 80 GB\n\nSo, Carla has downloaded 80 GB before the restart.\n\n3.

After 40% of the way through the download (0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB), Windows forces a restart. This means Carla has downloaded 80 GB in 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.\n4. The restart takes 20 minutes, so Carla has to wait for 20 minutes before restarting the download.\n5. Since Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, she has to download the entire 200 GB file again.\n6. The time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB (200 - 80 = 120) is 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.\n7. Adding the time it took to download the initial 80 GB (40 minutes) and the time it took to download the remaining 120 GB (60 minutes), the total download time is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer.

To find the point at which the restart occurs, we can calculate 40% of the total download time:\n\n40% of 100 minutes = 0.4 x 100 = 40 minutes\n\nSince Carla has downloaded 40 minutes' worth of data, she has downloaded 40/100 = 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB of the file.\n\n3.

To find the total distance John has covered, we add the distances from steps 1, 3, and 4:\n\nTotal Distance = 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles\n\nSince John is trying to get home, we subtract the total distance from the initial distance he drove (180 miles) to find the distance he is from home:\n\nDistance from home = Initial Distance - Total Distance = 180 miles - 315 miles = -135 miles\n\nSince distance cannot be negative, this means John is actually 135 miles away from home.
