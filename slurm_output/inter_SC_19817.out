Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. Since she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left, she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: After selling vacuum cleaners, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means the number of vacuum cleaners she sold is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

Step 6: Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 + 2) = 5

Step 8: Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - x/3 + 2 - 2 = 5

Step 9: Simplify further:

2x/3 - 4 = 5

Step 10: Add 4 to both sides:

2x/3 = 9

Step 11: Multiply both sides by 3:

2x = 27

Step 12: Divide both sides by 2:

x = 13.5

Since Melanie can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Melanie started with #### 14 vacuum cleaners.******

Step 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, this means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". Then, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is x - (x/2) = x/2. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 5

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners x. Then, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is x/3.

Step 2: Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 3: Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners left, subtract the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far from the initial number: x - (x/3 + 2).

Step 4: The number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, so set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2) = 5.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3) - 2 = 5.

Step 6: Add 2 to both sides: x - (x/3) = 7.

Step 7: Add x/3 to both sides: x = 7 + x/3.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 21 + x.

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 11: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners (round up from 10.5).

Step 5: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3) - 2 = 5.

Step 6: Add 2 to both sides: x - (x/3) = 7.

Step 7: Add x/3 to both sides: x = 7 + x/3.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 21 + x.

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 11: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners (round up from 10.5).

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at the green house, the red house, and the orange house. This is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

Step 6: Set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners x. Then, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is x/3.

Step 2: Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 3: Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners left, subtract the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far from the initial number: x - (x/3 + 2).

Step 4: The number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, so set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2) = 5.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3) - 2 = 5.

Step 6: Add 2 to both sides: x - (x/3) = 7.

Step 7: Add x/3 to both sides: x = 7 + x/3.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 21 + x.

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. Since she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left, she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: After selling vacuum cleaners, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means the number of vacuum cleaners she sold is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

Step 6: Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 + 2) = 5

Step 8: Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - x/3 + 2 - 2 = 5

Step 9: Simplify further:

2x/3 - 4 = 5

Step 10: Add 4 to both sides:

2x/3 = 9

Step 11: Multiply both sides by 3:

2x = 27

Step 12: Divide both sides by 2:

x = 13.5

Since Melanie can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Melanie started with #### 14 vacuum cleaners.******

Step 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, this means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". Then, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is x - (x/2) = x/2. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 5

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners x. Then, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is x/3.

Step 2: Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 3: Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners left, subtract the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far from the initial number: x - (x/3 + 2).

Step 4: The number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, so set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2) = 5.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3) - 2 = 5.

Step 6: Add 2 to both sides: x - (x/3) = 7.

Step 7: Add x/3 to both sides: x = 7 + x/3.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 21 + x.

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 11: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners (round up from 10.5).

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at the green house, the red house, and the orange house. This is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

Step 6: Set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: At the orange house, she sold half of what was left. Since she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left, she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: After selling vacuum cleaners, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means the number of vacuum cleaners she sold is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

Step 6: Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 + 2) = 5

Step 8: Combine like terms:

x - x/3 - x/3 + 2 - 2 = 5

Step 9: Simplify further:

2x/3 - 4 = 5

Step 10: Add 4 to both sides:

2x/3 = 9

Step 11: Multiply both sides by 3:

2x = 27

Step 2: Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, this means she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners "x". Then, the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is x - (x/2) = x/2. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation:

x/2 = 5

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners x. Then, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is x/3.

Step 2: Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 3: Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners left, subtract the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far from the initial number: x - (x/3 + 2).

Step 4: The number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, so set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2) = 5.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3) - 2 = 5.

Step 6: Add 2 to both sides: x - (x/3) = 7.

Step 7: Add x/3 to both sides: x = 7 + x/3.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 21 + x.

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 11: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners (round up from 10.5).

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at the green house, the red house, and the orange house. This is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

Step 6: Set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 8: Simplify further: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the initial number of vacuum cleaners x. Then, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is x/3.

Step 2: Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 3: Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners left, subtract the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far from the initial number: x - (x/3 + 2).

Step 4: The number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, so set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2) = 5.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3) - 2 = 5.

Step 6: Add 2 to both sides: x - (x/3) = 7.

Step 7: Add x/3 to both sides: x = 7 + x/3.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 21 + x.

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 11: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners (round up from 10.5).

Step 4: The number of vacuum cleaners left is 5, so set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2) = 5.

Step 5: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3) - 2 = 5.

Step 6: Add 2 to both sides: x - (x/3) = 7.

Step 7: Add x/3 to both sides: x = 7 + x/3.

Step 8: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 3x = 21 + x.

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides: 2x = 21.

Step 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.

Step 11: Since you can't have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, Melanie must have started with 11 vacuum cleaners (round up from 10.5).

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is x/3 + 2.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the vacuum cleaners sold at the green house, the red house, and the orange house. This is equal to the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with minus the number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

Step 6: Set up the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 8: Simplify further: x - (x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5

Step 9: Solve for x: x = 15

Step 1: Let's calculate the profit for each option.

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Profit = Value of jewelry after 2.5% increase = $5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Option 2: Electronic gadgets worth $8,000
Profit = Value of electronic gadgets after 1.2% increase = $8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Step 2: Compare the profits to determine which option is more profitable.

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

Step 3: Calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost from the final value.

Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Step 1: Let's calculate the profit for each option.

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Profit = Value of jewelry after 2.5% increase = $5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Option 2: Electronic gadgets worth $8,000
Profit = Value of electronic gadgets after 1.2% increase = $8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Step 2: Compare the profits to determine which option is more profitable.

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

Step 3: Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we compare the two options. The profit from the jewelry plan is $125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets plan is $96. ******

Step 1: Let's calculate the profit for each option.

Option 1: Jewelry worth $5,000
Profit = Value of jewelry after 2.5% increase = $5,000 + (2.5% of $5,000) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Option 2: Electronic gadgets worth $8,000
Profit = Value of electronic gadgets after 1.2% increase = $8,000 + (1.2% of $8,000) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Step 2: Compare the profits to determine which option is more profitable.

Since $8,096 is greater than $5,125, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000.

Step 3: Calculate the profit by subtracting the initial cost from the final value.

Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Step 4: The answer is #### 96.******

Step 1: Calculate the expected value of the jewelry after the market rise:

$5,000 x (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 x 1.025 = $5,125

Step 2: Calculate the expected value of the electronic gadgets after the market rise:

$8,000 x (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 x 1.012 = $8,096

Step 3: Calculate the profit for each option:

Jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
Electronic Gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Step 4: The merchant should choose the option that yields the highest profit:

$125 > $96

The merchant should choose the jewelry worth $5,000, which would result in a profit of #### 125.******

Step 1: Calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher:
She works 35 hours a week, and there are 50 weeks in a year, so she works a total of 35 * 50 = 1750 hours as a teacher.
Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20, so her annual salary as a teacher is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Step 2: Calculate Jill's annual salary as a cheerleading coach:
She works 15 hours a week, and there are 50 weeks in a year, so she works a total of 15 * 50 = 750 hours as a coach.
Her hourly wage as a coach is $30, so her annual salary as a coach is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Step 3: Add the annual salaries from both jobs:
Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her salary as a teacher and her salary as a coach: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

Her hourly wage as a teacher is $20, so her annual salary as a teacher is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Step 2: Calculate Jill's annual salary as a cheerleading coach:
She works 15 hours a week, and there are 50 weeks in a year, so she works a total of 15 * 50 = 750 hours as a coach.
Her hourly wage as a coach is $30, so her annual salary as a coach is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Step 3: Add the annual salaries from both jobs:
Jill's total annual salary is the sum of her salary as a teacher and her salary as a coach: $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink: 10 liters * (2/3) = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink: 15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters

Step 3: Add the amount of water from both drinks: 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters (approximately)

Step 4: Since 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, subtract 1 liter from the total: 15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters (approximately)

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters is a combination of the two drinks, so subtract the total water from the total volume: 24 liters - 14.67 liters = 9.33 liters (approximately)

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink initially. Since it's two-thirds water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

10 liters * (2/3) = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Step 2: Let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

15 liters * (3/5) = 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 liters = 9 liters

Step 3: The total amount of water initially is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks:

6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters

Step 4: Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we subtract that from the total:

15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters consist of the spilled 1 liter and the remaining 23 liters of the mixed drinks. We can find the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

23 liters - 1 liter (spilled orange drink) = 22 liters

Step 6: Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the non-water part is one-third of the drink. So, the amount of non-water in the spilled 1 liter is:

1 liter * (1/3) = 1/3 liter

Step 7: The remaining 22 liters consist of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks, and the non-water part from the spilled orange drink. We can find the amount of water by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

22 liters - 1/3 liter = 21.67 liters

Step 1: The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters.

Step 2: The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Initially, the total amount of water is 6.67 liters (from orange drink) + 9 liters (from pineapple drink) = 15.67 liters.

Step 4: One liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining amount of water is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Step 5: The total remaining amount is 24 liters, so the proportion of water in the remaining mixture is 14.67 / 24 = 0.6075.

Step 2: Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, the amount of water is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: The total amount of water in the initial mixture is 20/3 + 9 = 29/3 liters.

Step 4: As we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining mixture decreases by 2/3 liters (since 1 liter is 2/3 water).

Step 5: The new total amount of water is 29/3 - 2/3 = 27/3 liters.

Step 6: Since we're left with 24 liters in total, the remaining mixture is 24 - 1 = 23 liters (since 1 liter was spilled).

Step 7: The amount of water in the remaining 23 liters is 27/3 liters.

Step 8: To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we add the amount of water in the remaining mixture (27/3) to the amount of water in the spilled liter (2/3).

Step 9: The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 27/3 + 2/3 = 29/3 liters.

Step 10: To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 29/3 = 9.67 liters.

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink initially. Since it's two-thirds water, the amount of water is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

Step 2: Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, the amount of water is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: The total amount of water in the initial mixture is 20/3 + 9 = 29/3 liters.

Step 4: As we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining mixture decreases by 2/3 liters (since 1 liter is 2/3 water).

Step 5: The new total amount of water is 29/3 - 2/3 = 27/3 liters.

Step 6: Since we're left with 24 liters in total, the remaining mixture is 24 - 1 = 23 liters (since 1 liter was spilled).

Step 7: The amount of water in the remaining 23 liters is 27/3 liters.

Step 8: To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we add the amount of water in the remaining mixture (27/3) to the amount of water in the spilled liter (2/3).

Step 9: The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 27/3 + 2/3 = 29/3 liters.

Step 10: To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 29/3 = 9.67 liters.

Step 11: Since the problem asks for the answer in the format '#### {numeric answer}', we round the decimal to two decimal places: 9.67 → 9.67.

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink initially. Since it's two-thirds water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

10 liters * (2/3) = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Step 2: Let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

15 liters * (3/5) = 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 liters = 9 liters

Step 3: The total amount of water initially is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks:

6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters

Step 4: Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we subtract that from the total:

15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters consist of the spilled 1 liter and the remaining 23 liters of the mixed drinks. We can find the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

23 liters - 1 liter (spilled orange drink) = 22 liters

Step 6: Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the non-water part is one-third of the drink. So, the amount of non-water in the spilled 1 liter is:

1 liter * (1/3) = 1/3 liter

Step 7: The remaining 22 liters consist of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks, and the non-water part from the spilled orange drink. We can find the amount of water by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

Step 5: The total remaining amount is 24 liters, so the proportion of water in the remaining mixture is 14.67 / 24 = 0.6075.

Step 6: To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, multiply the proportion by the total amount: 0.6075 * 24 = 14.58 liters.

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink initially. Since it's two-thirds water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

10 liters * (2/3) = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Step 2: Let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

15 liters * (3/5) = 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 liters = 9 liters

Step 3: The total amount of water initially is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks:

6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters

Step 4: Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we subtract that from the total:

15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters consist of the spilled 1 liter and the remaining 23 liters of the mixed drinks. We can find the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

23 liters - 1 liter (spilled orange drink) = 22 liters

Step 6: Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the non-water part is one-third of the drink. So, the amount of non-water in the spilled 1 liter is:

1 liter * (1/3) = 1/3 liter

Step 7: The remaining 22 liters consist of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks, and the non-water part from the spilled orange drink. We can find the amount of water by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

22 liters - 1/3 liter = 21.67 liters

Step 2: Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, the amount of water is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: The total amount of water in the initial mixture is 20/3 + 9 = 29/3 liters.

Step 4: As we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining mixture decreases by 2/3 liters (since 1 liter is 2/3 water).

Step 5: The new total amount of water is 29/3 - 2/3 = 27/3 liters.

Step 6: Since we're left with 24 liters in total, the remaining mixture is 24 - 1 = 23 liters (since 1 liter was spilled).

Step 7: The amount of water in the remaining 23 liters is 27/3 liters.

Step 8: To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we add the amount of water in the remaining mixture (27/3) to the amount of water in the spilled liter (2/3).

Step 9: The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 27/3 + 2/3 = 29/3 liters.

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink initially. Since it's two-thirds water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

10 liters * (2/3) = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Step 2: Let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

15 liters * (3/5) = 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 liters = 9 liters

Step 3: The total amount of water initially is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks:

6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters

Step 4: Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we subtract that from the total:

15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters consist of the spilled 1 liter and the remaining 23 liters of the mixed drinks. We can find the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

23 liters - 1 liter (spilled orange drink) = 22 liters

Step 6: Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the non-water part is one-third of the drink. So, the amount of non-water in the spilled 1 liter is:

1 liter * (1/3) = 1/3 liter

Step 7: The remaining 22 liters consist of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks, and the non-water part from the spilled orange drink. We can find the amount of water by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

22 liters - 1/3 liter = 21.67 liters

Step 8: The answer is #### 21.67.******

Step 6: Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the non-water part is one-third of the drink. So, the amount of non-water in the spilled 1 liter is:

1 liter * (1/3) = 1/3 liter

Step 7: The remaining 22 liters consist of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks, and the non-water part from the spilled orange drink. We can find the amount of water by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink initially. Since it's two-thirds water, the amount of water is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters.

Step 2: Now, let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, the amount of water is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: The total amount of water in the initial mixture is 20/3 + 9 = 29/3 liters.

Step 4: As we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, the amount of water in the remaining mixture decreases by 2/3 liters (since 1 liter is 2/3 water).

Step 5: The new total amount of water is 29/3 - 2/3 = 27/3 liters.

Step 6: Since we're left with 24 liters in total, the remaining mixture is 24 - 1 = 23 liters (since 1 liter was spilled).

Step 7: The amount of water in the remaining 23 liters is 27/3 liters.

Step 8: To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we add the amount of water in the remaining mixture (27/3) to the amount of water in the spilled liter (2/3).

Step 9: The total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 27/3 + 2/3 = 29/3 liters.

Step 10: To convert this to a decimal, we can divide the numerator by the denominator: 29/3 = 9.67 liters.

Step 11: Since the problem asks for the answer in the format '#### {numeric answer}', we round the decimal to two decimal places: 9.67 → 9.67.

Step 1: Let's find the amount of water in the orange drink initially. Since it's two-thirds water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

10 liters * (2/3) = 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters = 6.67 liters (approximately)

Step 2: Let's find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Since it's three-fifths water, we can find the amount of water by multiplying the total volume by the fraction of water:

15 liters * (3/5) = 15 * (3/5) = 45/5 liters = 9 liters

Step 3: The total amount of water initially is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks:

6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters

Step 4: Since we spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we subtract that from the total:

15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters consist of the spilled 1 liter and the remaining 23 liters of the mixed drinks. We can find the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

23 liters - 1 liter (spilled orange drink) = 22 liters

Step 6: Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the non-water part is one-third of the drink. So, the amount of non-water in the spilled 1 liter is:

1 liter * (1/3) = 1/3 liter

Step 7: The remaining 22 liters consist of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks, and the non-water part from the spilled orange drink. We can find the amount of water by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

22 liters - 1/3 liter = 21.67 liters

Step 8: The answer is #### 21.67.******

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters consist of the spilled 1 liter and the remaining 23 liters of the mixed drinks. We can find the amount of water in the remaining 23 liters by subtracting the non-water part from the total:

23 liters - 1 liter (spilled orange drink) = 22 liters

Step 6: Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the non-water part is one-third of the drink. So, the amount of non-water in the spilled 1 liter is:

1 liter * (1/3) = 1/3 liter

Step 7: The remaining 22 liters consist of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks, and the non-water part from the spilled orange drink. We can find the amount of water by subtracting the non-water part from the total:
