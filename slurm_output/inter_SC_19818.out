Step 3: Since Josh spent $130,000 and the house is now worth $120,000, he made a loss of $130,000 - $120,000 = $10,000. ******

Step 4: The answer is #### -10,000. ******

Step 4: To find out when Carlos starts earning money, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for each year.

Year 1: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3 + $90 (initial cost) = $93, Net loss = $93 - $10.50 = -$82.50

Year 2: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net profit = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Since the net profit in Year 2 is positive, Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree in the second year.

Step 1: The initial cost of planting the tree is $90. ******

Step 2: The tree will grow 7 lemons each year, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the total revenue from selling lemons each year is 7 * $1.5 = $10.50. ******

Step 3: The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3. ******


Step 4: To find out when Carlos starts earning money, we need to calculate the total revenue and total cost for each year.

Year 1: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3 + $90 (initial cost) = $93, Net loss = $93 - $10.50 = -$82.50

Year 2: Revenue = $10.50, Cost = $3, Net profit = $10.50 - $3 = $7.50

Since the net profit in Year 2 is positive, Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree in the second year.

Step 4: To find out when Carlos starts earning money, we need to find the number of years it takes for the revenue to be greater than the cost. Let's calculate the net profit per year: $10.50 (revenue) - $3 (cost) = $7.50. ******


Step 5: Since the tree costs $90 to plant, Carlos needs to earn $90 in net profit to break even. To find the number of years it takes, we can divide the cost by the net profit: $90 / $7.50 = 12. ******

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with "x". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.

Step 2: She has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

Step 5: After selling at the orange house, she has 2x/3 - 2 - x/3 = x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 6: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: x/3 = 5.

Step 7: To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 3: x = 15.

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, this means she sold (x - x/3 - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: We can set up an equation to represent the situation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 6: Simplify the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5

Step 7: Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6x - 2x - 12 - 3(x - x/3 - 2) = 30

Step 8: Simplify the equation: 3x - 12 - 3x + 3 + 6 = 30

Step 9: Combine like terms: -12 + 6 = 30

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

Step 13: The answer is #### 9.******

Step 1: Let's start by using variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

Step 2: She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

Step 3: She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 4: She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.

Step 5: Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.

Step 6: We can set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = x - 5

Step 8: Add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = x - 5 + x/3

Step 9: Subtract x from both sides:

-2 = -5 + x/3

Step 10: Multiply both sides by 3:

-6 = -15 + x

Step 11: Add 15 to both sides:

-6 + 15 = x

Step 12: Simplify:

9 = x

Step 13: The answer is #### 9.******

Step 1: Let's calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the jewelry option.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= (5,000 x (1 + 0.025)) - 5,000
= 5,000 x 0.025
= 125

Step 2: Let's calculate the profit if the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets option.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
= (8,000 x (1 + 0.012)) - 8,000
= 8,000 x 0.012
= 96

Step 3: Since the merchant wants to maximize profit, we need to compare the profits from both options.

The profit from the jewelry option is 125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets option is 96. Since 125 is greater than 96, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize profit.

Step 1: The orange drink is 2/3 water, so 10 liters of orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so 15 liters of pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters of water.

Step 3: In total, there is 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink and 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink, making a total of 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters of water.

Step 4: As 1 liter of orange drink is spilled, the total amount of water is reduced by 1 liter, leaving 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water.

Step 5: The total volume of the remaining drink is 24 liters, and the amount of water in it is 14.67 liters.

Step 1: First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a liter, we'll round it to 6.67 liters. This means the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Now, we pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, but spill 1 liter. This means we add 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink to the pineapple drink.

Step 4: The total amount of water in the combined drinks is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks minus the spilled liter. The total water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters include the combined drinks, so we subtract the total water from the total volume to find the amount of non-water content: 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

Step 6: Finally, the remaining 24 liters contain 14.67 liters of water and 9.33 liters of non-water content.

Step 1: First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a liter, we'll round it to 6.67 liters. This means the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Now, we pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, but spill 1 liter. This means we add 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink to the pineapple drink.

Step 1: First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a liter, we'll round it to 6.67 liters. This means the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Now, we pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, but spill 1 liter. This means we add 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink to the pineapple drink.

Step 4: The total amount of water in the combined drinks is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks minus the spilled liter. The total water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters include the combined drinks, so we subtract the total water from the total volume to find the amount of non-water content: 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

Step 6: Finally, the remaining 24 liters contain 14.67 liters of water and 9.33 liters of non-water content.

The answer is: #### 14.67******

Step 6: Finally, the remaining 24 liters contain 14.67 liters of water and 9.33 liters of non-water content.

The answer is: #### 14.67******

Step 1: First, let's find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a liter, we'll round it to 6.67 liters. This means the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water.

Step 2: Next, let's find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters.

Step 3: Now, we pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, but spill 1 liter. This means we add 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink to the pineapple drink.

Step 4: The total amount of water in the combined drinks is the sum of the water in the orange and pineapple drinks minus the spilled liter. The total water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.

Step 5: The remaining 24 liters include the combined drinks, so we subtract the total water from the total volume to find the amount of non-water content: 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.

The total water is 6.67 + 9 - 1 = 14.67 liters.\n\nStep 5: The remaining 24 liters include the combined drinks, so we subtract the total water from the total volume to find the amount of non-water content: 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters.\n\nStep 6: Finally, the remaining 24 liters contain 14.67 liters of water and 9.33 liters of non-water content.\n\nThe answer is: #### 14.67******", '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: We start with 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. ****** Step 2: Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water. ****** Step 3: We also have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. ****** Step 4: Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters of water. ****** Step 5: Now we add the two drinks together, but we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. ****** Step 6: So we add 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink and 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink, minus 1 liter that was spilled, which is 9 + 6.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water. ****** Step 7: We have 24 liters of the combined drinks, so the remaining water is 14.67 liters. ****** Step 8: The answer is #### 14.67. ******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: We start with 10 liters of orange drink that is two-thirds water. ****** Step 2: Two-thirds of 10 liters is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 = 6.67 liters of water. ****** Step 3: We also have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. ****** Step 4: Three-fifths of 15 liters is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters of water. ****** Step 5: Now we add the two drinks together, but we spill 1 liter of the orange drink. ****** Step 6: So we add 9 liters of water from the pineapple drink and 6.67 liters of water from the orange drink, minus 1 liter that was spilled, which is 9 + 6.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of water. ****** Step 7: We have 24 liters of the combined drinks, so the remaining water is 14.67 liters. ****** Step 8: The answer is #### 14.67. ******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters. ****** Step 2: The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters. ****** Step 3: The total amount of water initially is 20/3 + 9 = 17 liters. ****** Step 4: One liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the total amount of water remaining is 17 - 1 = 16 liters. ****** Step 5: The total amount of drink remaining is 24 liters, so the amount of water in the remaining drink is 16 liters. ****** Step 6: The answer is #### 16. ******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nStep 1: The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters. ****** Step 2: The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters. ****** Step 3: The total amount of water initially is 20/3 + 9 = 17 liters. ****** Step 4: One liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the total amount of water remaining is 17 - 1 = 16 liters. ****** Step 5: The total amount of drink remaining is 24 liters, so the amount of water in the remaining drink is 16 liters. ****** Step 6: The answer is #### 16. ******']

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let the original price of the book be x.

Step 2: The discount is 25%, which means the discount amount is 25% of the original price, or 0.25x.

Step 3: The sale price is the original price minus the discount, which is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

Step 4: The sale price is given as $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

Step 5: To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Step 6: Simplify the fraction:

x = 26.00

Step 7: The original price of the book was $26.00.

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let the original price of the book be x.

Step 2: The discount is 25%, which means the discount amount is 25% of the original price, or 0.25x.

Step 3: The sale price is the original price minus the discount, which is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

Step 4: The sale price is given as $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

Step 5: To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Step 6: Simplify the fraction:

x = 26.00

Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Let the original price of the book be x.

Step 2: The discount is 25%, which means the discount amount is 25% of the original price, or 0.25x.

Step 3: The sale price is the original price minus the discount, which is x - 0.25x = 0.75x.

Step 4: The sale price is given as $19.50, so we can set up the equation:

0.75x = 19.50

Step 5: To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 0.75:

x = 19.50 / 0.75

Step 6: Simplify the fraction:

x = 26.00

Step 7: The original price of the book was $26.00.

Step 1: Marie ordered a chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each. ******

Step 2: The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
$12 + (5 x $3) + (4 x $1.50) = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 3: Marie paid a total of $50. The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $33. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17

Step 4: Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

Step 1: The total cost of the meal, milk, and apples is calculated.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Total cost of meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: The total amount Marie paid is $50. The difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the meal, milk, and apples is the cost of the pizza.

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of meal, milk, and apples) = $17

Step 3: The cost of each box of pizza is $8.50. To find the number of boxes of pizza, divide the cost of the pizza ($17) by the cost of each box ($8.50).

$17 (cost of pizza) ÷ $8.50 (cost of each box) = 2

Step 1: The total cost of the meal, milk, and apples is calculated.

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6

Total cost of meal, milk, and apples: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: The total amount Marie paid is $50. The difference between the total amount paid and the cost of the meal, milk, and apples is the cost of the pizza.

$50 (total paid) - $33 (cost of meal, milk, and apples) = $17

Step 3: The cost of each box of pizza is $8.50. To find the number of boxes of pizza, divide the cost of the pizza ($17) by the cost of each box ($8.50).

$17 (cost of pizza) ÷ $8.50 (cost of each box) = 2

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Let's call the cost of the boots "x".

Step 2: The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, so we can set up the equation:

Heels 1 + Heels 2 = x - 5

Step 3: One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so we can write:

Heels 1 = $33
Heels 2 = 2 * $33 = $66

Step 4: Substitute the values of Heels 1 and Heels 2 into the equation:

$33 + $66 = x - 5

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

$99 = x - 5

Step 6: Add 5 to both sides to get:

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Let's call the cost of the boots "x".

Step 2: The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, so we can set up the equation:

Heels 1 + Heels 2 = x - 5

Step 3: One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so we can write:

Heels 1 = $33
Heels 2 = 2 * $33 = $66

Step 4: Substitute the values of Heels 1 and Heels 2 into the equation:

$33 + $66 = x - 5

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

$99 = x - 5

Step 6: Add 5 to both sides to get:

$104 = x

Step 7: The answer is #### 104.******

Let's break this problem down step by step:

Step 1: Let's call the cost of the boots "x".

Step 2: The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, so we can set up the equation:

Heels 1 + Heels 2 = x - 5

Step 3: One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, so we can write:

Heels 1 = $33
Heels 2 = 2 * $33 = $66

Step 4: Substitute the values of Heels 1 and Heels 2 into the equation:

$33 + $66 = x - 5

Step 5: Simplify the equation:

$99 = x - 5

Step 6: Add 5 to both sides to get:

$104 = x
