Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\nAnswer: We start with 15 trees. Later we have 21 trees.The difference must be the number of trees they planted. So, they must have planted 21-15=6 trees.The answer is #### 6.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nExample Problem example2: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\nAnswer: There are 3 cars in the parking lot already. 2 more arrive.

If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\nAnswer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is #### 39.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nExample Problem example4: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?\nAnswer: Jason had 20 lollipops. Since he only has 12 now, he must have given the rest to Denny. The number of lollipops he has given to Denny must have been 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops.
