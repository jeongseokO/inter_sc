Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of that is 5/2 = 2.5 vacuum cleaners. So, she sold 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.\n\nStep 5: Now, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, which is the result of selling 2.5 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. To find the number of vacuum cleaners she had before selling at the orange house, we subtract 2.5 from 5: 5 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 6: Since she has 2.5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house, we can set up the equation: 2x/3 - 2 - 2.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation: 2x/3 - 4.5 = 2.5.\n\nStep 8: Add 4.5 to both sides: 2x/3 = 7.\n\nStep 9: Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction: 2x = 21.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by 2: x = 10.5.\n\nStep 11: Since Melanie can\'t have a fraction of a vacuum cleaner, we round up to the nearest whole number: x = 11.\n\n#### 11******', '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nLet\'s break this problem down step by step:\n\nStep 1: Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
