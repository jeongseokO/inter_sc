The bank later modified its loan, extending the amortization period but not changing the interest rate or principal amount. The mother was not informed of the modification.\n\nStep 2: Determine the priority of the liens: The bank's mortgage was recorded first, making it a prior lien.

The wavelengths of the hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. ****** Step 2: Let's denote the wavelength of the hydrogen line at rest as λ0. Then, the wavelength of the hydrogen line observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 is 3λ0. ****** Step 3: The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is given by:\n\nλ' = λ0 / (1 + v/c)\n\nwhere λ' is the observed wavelength, λ0 is the rest wavelength, v is the relative velocity between the source and the observer, and c is the speed of light. ****** Step 4: We are given that the observed wavelength is three times the rest wavelength, so we can set up the equation:\n\n3λ0 = λ0 / (1 + v/c)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by (1 + v/c):\n\n3λ0(1 + v/c) = λ0\n\nStep 6: Simplify further by canceling out λ0:\n\n3 + 3v/c = 1\n\nStep 7: Subtract 1 from both sides to get:\n\n2 = 3v/c\n\nStep 8: Multiply both sides by c/3 to get:\n\n2c/3 = v\n\nStep 9: Divide both sides by 2 to get:\n\nc/3 = v\n\nStep 10: Multiply both sides by 3 to get:\n\nc = 3v\n\nStep 11: Since v is the relative velocity between the quasar and Earth, it is a fraction of the speed of light. Therefore, v = 0.5c. ****** Step 12: Therefore, the correct answer is #### D:0.5c.******"]
